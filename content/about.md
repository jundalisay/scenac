SCENAC was founded on December 11, 2003 a Non-Government Organization (NGO) representing the disadvantaged elderly and children sector as a partner  <!-- extension agency --> of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).

We focus on humanitarian and social development assistance in the form of:
- medical treatment <!-- advocating urgently needed -->
- food assistance for maintenance and survival
<!--  as charity or service patients for serious health conditions and providing temporary shelter for troubled and displaced street children. -->

As a non-stock, non-profit organization <!-- , it has no budgeting allocations from both the local and national government. As such it --> we operate on the principles of:

1. Volunteerism 
2. Cooperation 
3. Multi-Stakeholdership



##### Vision

##### Rationale

The issue of aging has become a major concern worldwide. <!-- not only of the developed countries but also the developing and underdeveloped countries. -->

Curative and preventive interventions that seek to support the special needs of the senior citizen and to reduce risks associated with old age shall be provided.

Senior Citizens Act No. 3994 was enacted into law to protect seniors from abuse, exploitation and discrimination. It aims to establish, within the famity and community level, the prevention of physical, emotional and financial abuse, neglect and abandonment of senior citizens. 

SCENAC supports this law through:
- training and awareness campaigns that raise public awareness on the problems confronting senior citizens
- provide means to <!--  and to equip the public with the necessary â€œknow-how" to --> allow the public to <!-- prevent and --> detect and report the problems that afflict seniors<!--  problem areas concerning these sectors. -->
