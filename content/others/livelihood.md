<!-- OYERVIEW OF LIYELIBOOD PROGRAMS -->

SCENAC helps livelihoods by conducting trainings and seminars on micro-processing and the distribution of consumer products in urban poor communities. These focus on enterprising individuals and organizations who might be interested in selling consumer products as a livelihood opportunity.

<!-- In its limited capacity, SCENAC resources participated and led various undertakings to address the inefficiencies and utter lack of facilities in this depressed sector of society. The activity consists of establishment and/or rehabilitation of inactive industry associations, cooperatives and zone (purok) organizations thru product info, marketing seminars and encouragement of the people to actively involve themselves in livelihood projects, in order to strengthen their role in nation building. Thus far, SCENAC has acquired a data bank of ideas, insights and experiences including partners in trade that will provide assistance to families in the urban poor communities in effecting the livelihood projects and programs. -->
